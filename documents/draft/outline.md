# Application of Supervised Learning Methods to Transformation Mechanisms in DBPs Formation in simulated drinking water distribution network

During the chloramination process in drinking water treatment, interactions between disinfectants, natural organic matter (NOM), and halide ions can lead to the formation of harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes and haloacids. This study aims to simulate the disinfection and distribution processes, systematically monitor variations across different spatial and temporal scales, and focus on uncovering the underlying transformation mechanisms and their interrelationships. By using supervised machine learning techniques—such as clustering analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), the research seeks to excavate the complex and latent relationships among disinfectant levels, NOM characteristics, and DBPs formation. This approach provides insights into the intrinsic pathways and interactions driving DBP formation, contributing to a deeper understanding of their mechanistic basis.
